# Todo API
A simple node.js - express.js API with CRUD operations. 
It has **4** routes: 
- `/` to get all todos
- `/add` to add a new todo to Todos list (requires `{name: "go through docs"}`)
- `/update` to update a todo whether it is done or not (requires `_id` )
- `/delete` to delete a todo (requires `_id` )
